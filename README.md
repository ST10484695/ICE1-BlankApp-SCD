## Purpose of this task:

This task was assigned for Mobile App Scripting(MAST5112) module.The purpose of this task was to individually help us understand how to set up the VScode environment before offically coding.

## How i had set up:
* I had created a folder in my files that was within Documents called "IceTaskOne".
* I had to create another file within the IceTaskOne which i then called "FirstTask".
* I input the codes which allowed me access to a blank template with a default text.
* i changed the text to a greeting and the background color to experiment with this new coding environment.

### Difficulties in doing this:
The one problem i had while doing this was intially linking the files together, i had been confused for most of the process but had to retrace what we did in class to finally link the 2.Once the profiles where linked the process had become easier.
